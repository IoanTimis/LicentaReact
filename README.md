# Online BSc/MSc Thesis Selection Platform

[ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ Versiune Ã®n romÃ¢nÄƒ / Romanian version](README-RO.md)

This project is designed to digitalize and automate the process of selecting BSc/MSc thesis topics for students and professors. It provides a structured and efficient approach to thesis management.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend: Next.js
- **Redux** â€“ for global state management
- **Redux Persist** â€“ to persist Redux state across page reloads (used specifically for user data)
- **Axios** â€“ for making HTTP requests to the backend
- **Nodemailer** â€“ used for sending emails (handled in API routes)
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Heroicons** â€“ for modern, scalable SVG icons
### Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- **Sequelize ORM** â€“ for MySQL database modeling and interaction
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** â€“ for secure authentication via tokens
- **Bcryptjs** â€“ for hashing passwords securely
- **Sanitize-HTML** â€“ to prevent XSS and sanitize user input
- **Dotenv** â€“ for managing environment variables
- **Cors** â€“ for handling cross-origin resource sharing
- **Cookie-parser** â€“ for parsing and setting cookies
### Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0 integrated with JWT
- Users authenticate via their Google account
- Roles and profile completion are managed based on email verification and system rules
### Database: MySQL
- Managed through Sequelize, supporting relationships between tables
### Testing & Dev Tools:
- **Cypress** â€“ for end-to-end testing
- **Nodemon** â€“ for hot reloading during backend development
- **Artillery** â€“ for load testing and performance benchmarking of HTTP APIs and web applications  

### **Security Measures**  
The platform implements multiple security layers to ensure data protection and prevent unauthorized actions:  

- **Backend Middleware:** Ensures that users can only perform actions allowed for their role (admin, teacher, or student).  
- **Frontend Middleware:** Restricts access to pages based on the userâ€™s role, preventing unauthorized navigation.  
- **Unauthorized Actions Prevention:** Every action, such as attempting to delete a request or topic that does not belong to the user, is validated at the backend level and blocked if unauthorized.  

These security measures help maintain the integrity and reliability of the platform.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

```

Start the backend and frontend:
```bash
cd server && npm start server.js
```

```bash
cd client && npm run dev
```

## Cypress Testing

To run Cypress tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Ensure the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test` before running the tests.


3. Open the Cypress interface:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

4. In the Cypress interface:
   - Select **E2E Testing**.
   - Choose your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome).
   - You will see three test files. Select the file you want to test and view the results.

## Artillery Testing

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Ensure the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test` before running the tests.

3. Open the `load-test.yml` file and follow the instructions to replicate the existing tests, or define your own scenarios.

4. Start testing:

   ```bash
   npx artillery run load-test.yml --output <outputFileName>.json
   ```
5. Review your results in `<outputFileName>.json`, or use Artillery Cloud to generate an HTML report as outlined on their website [https://app.artillery.io/](https://app.artillery.io/).

## Open the application in a browser. Replace with the port specified in your .env file
http://localhost:[PORT]

## Walkthrough
Note: This is a public demo of an earlier version of the platform and may not include the latest features or improvements. The walkthrough below uses images from a previous version of the application.

### **Landing Page**
The landing page allows users to navigate to different sections of the platform and select their preferred language (Romanian or English).  
![Landing Page](docs/images/LandingPageEn.png)

---

### **Login Page**
Authentication is available exclusively via Google OAuth. However, standard login remains enabled for testing purposes. If an organization is specified in Google OAuth settings, users must belong to that organization to log in.  
![Login Page](docs/images/LoginEn.png)

---

### **Admin Dashboard**
Upon logging in, administrators must first add faculties, specializations, and teacher emails to set up the system.  
![Admin Dashboard](docs/images/adminDashboard.png)

---

### **Admin Faculties Management**
Administrators can perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on faculties from this page.  
![Admin Faculties Page](docs/images/adminFaculties.png)

---

### **Teacher Home Page**
Once an admin has added a teacherâ€™s email, they can log in using Google. If the email belongs to a registered teacher, they will be redirected to the teacherâ€™s home page.  
![Teacher Home Page](docs/images/LandingTeacherEn.png)

---

### **Teacher Topics Page (OnlyTeachers Disabled)**
If `ONLYTEACHERS=false` is set in the environment variables, students are allowed on the platform. However, in this state, teachers **cannot** add new topics.  
This restriction exists because initially, only teachers should have full control over topics. Once students are onboarded, teachers are **limited to modifying only the number of available slots**.  
Before allowing students, the system should be set to `ONLYTEACHERS=true`.  
![Teacher Topics Page](docs/images/TeacherThemesFalseEn.png)

---

### **Teacher Topics Page (OnlyTeachers Enabled)**
When `ONLYTEACHERS=true`, **only teachers** can log in. They have complete control over topics, including the ability to create, update, and delete them.  
Teachers can filter topics by **education level (BSc/MSc)** or **available slots** and search topics by **title and keywords**.  
![Teacher Topics Page (OnlyTeachers Enabled)](docs/images/TeacherThemesTrueEn.png)

---

### **Teacher Requests Page**
Teachers can **accept, reject, or delete** student requests for topics.  
Whenever a teacher takes an action, an **automated email** is sent to the student with details about the request status.  
If a request is **accepted or rejected**, the response will also be logged as a **comment on the request**.  
Teachers can filter requests by **status** and search requests by **student name, first name, or topic title**.  
![Teacher Requests Page](docs/images/TeacherRequestsEn.png)
